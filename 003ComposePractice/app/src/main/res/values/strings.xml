    <string name="basic_description">Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native
        Android UI. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code,
        powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
    </string>
    <string name="basic_message">In this tutorial, you build a simple UI component with
        declarative functions. You call Compose functions to say what elements you want and the
        Compose compiler does the rest. Compose is built around Composable functions. These
        functions let you define your app\'s UI programmatically because they let you describe
        how it should look and provide data dependencies, rather than focus on the process of
        the UI\'s construction, such as initializing an element and then attaching it to a parent.
        To create a Composable function, you add the @Composable annotation to the function name.
